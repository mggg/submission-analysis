We have unique needs, a unique people, and often feel our voice is underrepresented. I would encourage the commission to not treat Michigan's northern district as an \"everything else\" category. Consider that, even though they are in the same district, it takes almost as much time to drive from Ironwood to Traverse City as it does to drive from Detroit to Washington DC.   \n",

       "248  Powell Township is the largest land wise township in the largest county (Marquette) with the smallest population in the county. It literally  is \"at the end of the road\" All activity...shopping, doctors, some worship, hospital, high schools, are in the City of Marquette or surrounding area. We are predominantly a recreational community, with service types of business. 2 churches, 2 bars, a community convenient store/gas/cafe, multiple motels, hotel, B &B.  The greater developed part of the community is along the County Road 550 that follows the shore of Lake Superior up from Marquette and the area around the inland lake called Lake Independence. We have a County Park, and County Marina in Powell Township. The population is roughly 2200 according to last available census. Population is older with a major portion being retired. We have a K-8 school with average attendance 55.    \n",

My Community of Interest is called the Southern Grand Rapids Metropolitan Area. \\n\\nI’m asking the commission to draw districts that keep our community intact! \\n\\nWe are compromised of the southern half of Grand Rapids, and the entire cities of Wyoming, and Kentwood. There are roughly 200,000 residents in our community of interest. \\n\\nThe City of Wyoming Vision statement perfectly summarizes the character of our community, “A diverse, strong, and authentic community where all individuals have the opportunity to thrive.” \\n\\nIf you find yourself in town, I hope you’ll visit the Beltine Bar for the world famous wet burrito! \\n\\nHistorically, our Community has been a mix of working classes suburbs, but we are quickly urbanizing and growing. In fact, we are the fasting growing area in Kent County. \\n\\nThe rapid growth of our community requires representation that understands the issues and challenges we face. Our top issues include, affordable housing, environmental clean up, and improving reliable mass transit.\\n\\nThe cost of housing is going up quickly. In fact, my rent has increased 5% in this past year alone. As for the health and safety of our community, we have half of Kent county’s federal superfund cleanup sites, even though we represent only 1/4 of the county population. \\n\\nFor a community of 200,000, it is frustrating that we were split apart by the 2011 district maps. Currently, we are in two congressional districts, 3 State Senate Districts, and 5 State House Districts. \\n\\nWe deserve to be represented by 1 congressional district, 2 state house districts, and 1 state senate district. \\nThis commission can help the Southern Grand Rapids Metropolitan Community of Interest by drawing district lines that keep our community whole.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In Kent County there are 6 core metro cities. These are Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Wyoming, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids. They are a clear community of interest based on shared services and similar forms of government. The 6 cities have several unique partnerships that they do together and not with outlying townships. The most well known is that they share the Rapid Transit System. They also partner together to send all their garbage to the incinerator which burns garbage to produce energy. This is the only incinerator that remains in use in Michigan. Many of the 6 cities also partner with the city of Grand Rapids on water and sewer, such as Kentwood, East Grand Rapids, and Walker. The 6 cities also share a form of government that is dramatically different than surrounding townships. Cities have their own police departments, fire departments, park systems, and they take care of their own streets. To the contrary, townships rely on county services such as the county sheriff, volunteer fire departments, the county park systems, the county road commission, and they deliver fewer services because they are restricted to 5 mils of taxes. However you draw districts for State House, State Senate, and Congress. Please keep the 6 cities together as much as possible.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>As a resident of East Grand Rapids, I’m writing to ask you to keep the core metro six cities together as much as possible in state house, state senate, and congressional districts. \\n\\nThese urban cities (Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Walker, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids) are significantly different from the surrounding townships that are mostly rural or far out suburban and therefore are interested in different laws coming from Lansing and DC. \\n\\nFirst, these two groups divide themselves on a state-wide and local level. At the state level, cities are organized into the Michigan Municipal League and townships are in the Michigan Townships Association. Here in Kent County, the six cities meet in the Urban Metro Mayors and Managers and the townships get together as the Kent County Township Supervisors group. So, you can see that when municipalities group into federations they divide cities from townships, and you should do the same. \\n\\nSecond, cities and townships are just different in Michigan law, in how their residents encounter local government, and in the issues that they deal with. \\nCities have their own police departments, fire department, parks, and have water/sewer infrastructure. A representative from a city will be more focused on working on behalf of cities and their particular issues. \\nTownships are not allowed to have more than 2 (by trustees) or 5 (with voter approval) mills of property taxes, so they offer far fewer services. They tend to rely on state and county governments for their law enforcement (the Sheriff), parks, and roads (county road commission). Township residents in Michigan tend to have septic systems and wells, instead of being on piped water and sewer. A representative from a township will be more focused on working on behalf of townships and their particular and unique issues.\\n\\nFinally, the six metro cities combine with only themselves on services such as public transit (The Rapid) and garbage (the incinerator). \\n\\nSo, for all of these reasons, try to draw maps that keep cities with cities and townships with townships. In Kent County, that means keeping the core six cities together as much as possible. In the last gerrymandered state house map, East Grand Rapids was put together with exurban and rural townships that don't share our interests and I think that shouldn't happen this time.

There are roughly 200,000 residents in our community of interest. \\n\\nThe City of Wyoming Vision statement perfectly summarizes the character of our community, “A diverse, strong, and authentic community where all individuals have the opportunity to thrive.” \\n\\nIf you find yourself in town, I hope you’ll visit the Beltine Bar for the world famous wet burrito! \\n\\nHistorically, our Community has been a mix of working classes suburbs, but we are quickly urbanizing and growing. In fact, we are the fasting growing area in Kent County. \\n\\nThe rapid growth of our community requires representation that understands the issues and challenges we face. Our top issues include, affordable housing, environmental clean up, and improving reliable mass transit.\\n\\nThe cost of housing is going up quickly. In fact, my rent has increased 5% in this past year alone. As for the health and safety of our community, we have half of Kent county’s federal superfund cleanup sites, even though we represent only 1/4 of the county population. \\n\\nFor a community of 200,000, it is frustrating that we were split apart by the 2011 district maps. Currently, we are in two congressional districts, 3 State Senate Districts, and 5 State House Districts. \\n\\nWe deserve to be represented by 1 congressional district, 2 state house districts, and 1 state senate district. \\nThis commission can help the Southern Grand Rapids Metropolitan Community of Interest by drawing district lines that keep our community whole.    \n",

These are Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Wyoming, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids. They are a clear community of interest based on shared services and similar forms of government. The 6 cities have several unique partnerships that they do together and not with outlying townships. The most well known is that they share the Rapid Transit System. They also partner together to send all their garbage to the incinerator which burns garbage to produce energy. This is the only incinerator that remains in use in Michigan. Many of the 6 cities also partner with the city of Grand Rapids on water and sewer, such as Kentwood, East Grand Rapids, and Walker. The 6 cities also share a form of government that is dramatically different than surrounding townships. Cities have their own police departments, fire departments, park systems, and they take care of their own streets. To the contrary, townships rely on county services such as the county sheriff, volunteer fire departments, the county park systems, the county road commission, and they deliver fewer services because they are restricted to 5 mils of taxes. However you draw districts for State House, State Senate, and Congress. Please keep the 6 cities together as much as possible.\\n   \n",
       "305  As a resident of East Grand Rapids, I’m writing to ask you to keep the core metro six cities together as much as possible in state house, state senate, and congressional districts. \\n\\nThese urban cities (Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Walker, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids) are significantly different from the surrounding townships that are mostly rural or far out suburban and therefore are interested in different laws coming from Lansing and DC. \\n\\nFirst, these two groups divide themselves on a state-wide and local level. At the state level, cities are organized into the Michigan Municipal League and townships are in the Michigan Townships Association. Here in Kent County, the six cities meet in the Urban Metro Mayors and Managers and the townships get together as the Kent County Township Supervisors group. So, you can see that when municipalities group into federations they divide cities from townships, and you should do the same. \\n\\nSecond, cities and townships are just different in Michigan law, in how their residents encounter local government, and in the issues that they deal with. \\nCities have their own police departments, fire department, parks, and have water/sewer infrastructure. A representative from a city will be more focused on working on behalf of cities and their particular issues. \\nTownships are not allowed to have more than 2 (by trustees) or 5 (with voter approval) mills of property taxes, so they offer far fewer services. They tend to rely on state and county governments for their law enforcement (the Sheriff), parks, and roads (county road commission). Township residents in Michigan tend to have septic systems and wells, instead of being on piped water and sewer. A representative from a township will be more focused on working on behalf of townships and their particular and unique issues.\\n\\nFinally, the six metro cities combine with only themselves on services such as public transit (The Rapid) and garbage (the incinerator). \\n\\nSo, for all of these reasons, try to draw maps that keep cities with cities and townships with townships. In Kent County, that means keeping the core six cities together as much as possible. In the last gerrymandered state house map, East Grand Rapids was put together with exurban and rural townships that don't share our interests and I think that shouldn't happen this time. Thanks.    \n",

Kentwood is a highly diverse but community-oriented part of West Michigan centered around an incredibly inclusive school system. That school system's identity ties together the diverse voices of the area and allows people to find their first \"home.\" Statistically, this cultural hearth I believe is relevant to politics because, despite ethnic and national differences within the community, community voters are conscious of the Kentwood community on a business and education level. That deserves a concrete voice.   \n",

       "      <td>My name is Charlie and I live in Grand Rapids, Michigan. My Community of Interest is called the Southern Grand Rapids Metropolitan Area. \\n\\nI’m asking the commission to draw districts that keep our community intact! \\n\\nWe are compromised of the southern half of Grand Rapids, and the entire cities of Wyoming, and Kentwood. There are roughly 200,000 residents in our community of interest. \\n\\nThe City of Wyoming Vision statement perfectly summarizes the character of our community, “A diverse, strong, and authentic community where all individuals have the opportunity to thrive.” \\n\\nIf you find yourself in town, I hope you’ll visit the Beltine Bar for the world famous wet burrito! \\n\\nHistorically, our Community has been a mix of working classes suburbs, but we are quickly urbanizing and growing. In fact, we are the fasting growing area in Kent County. \\n\\nThe rapid growth of our community requires representation that understands the issues and challenges we face. Our top issues include, affordable housing, environmental clean up, and improving reliable mass transit.\\n\\nThe cost of housing is going up quickly. In fact, my rent has increased 5% in this past year alone.

       "      <td>As a resident of East Grand Rapids, I’m writing to ask you to keep the core metro six cities together as much as possible in state house, state senate, and congressional districts. \\n\\nThese urban cities (Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Walker, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids) are significantly different from the surrounding townships that are mostly rural or far out suburban and therefore are interested in different laws coming from Lansing and DC. \\n\\nFirst, these two groups divide themselves on a state-wide and local level. At the state level, cities are organized into the Michigan Municipal League and townships are in the Michigan Townships Association. Here in Kent County, the six cities meet in the Urban Metro Mayors and Managers and the townships get together as the Kent County Township Supervisors group. So, you can see that when municipalities group into federations they divide cities from townships, and you should do the same. \\n\\nSecond, cities and townships are just different in Michigan law, in how their residents encounter local government, and in the issues that they deal with. \\nCities have their own police departments, fire department, parks, and have water/sewer infrastructure. A representative from a city will be more focused on working on behalf of cities and their particular issues. \\nTownships are not allowed to have more than 2 (by trustees) or 5 (with voter approval) mills of property taxes, so they offer far fewer services. They tend to rely on state and county governments for their law enforcement (the Sheriff), parks, and roads (county road commission). Township residents in Michigan tend to have septic systems and wells, instead of being on piped water and sewer. A representative from a township will be more focused on working on behalf of townships and their particular and unique issues.\\n\\nFinally, the six metro cities combine with only themselves on services such as public transit (The Rapid) and garbage (the incinerator). \\n\\nSo, for all of these reasons, try to draw maps that keep cities with cities and townships with townships. In Kent County, that means keeping the core six cities together as much as possible. In the last gerrymandered state house map, East Grand Rapids was put together with exurban and rural townships that don't share our interests and I think that shouldn't happen this time.

Both school districts have a fair percentage of minority students and students receiving free and reduced-price school meals.  Right now, these parents have to talk to 2 Michigan House Representatives/district and their influence is diminished when they try to lobby their representatives.  They should all be part of one district and if House District 90 went all the way west to Lake Michigan, while not extending as far east, that would put most of both districts under one Michigan House seat.   \n",

These are Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Wyoming, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids. They are a clear community of interest based on shared services and similar forms of government. The 6 cities have several unique partnerships that they do together and not with outlying townships. The most well known is that they share the Rapid Transit System. They also partner together to send all their garbage to the incinerator which burns garbage to produce energy. This is the only incinerator that remains in use in Michigan. Many of the 6 cities also partner with the city of Grand Rapids on water and sewer, such as Kentwood, East Grand Rapids, and Walker. The 6 cities also share a form of government that is dramatically different than surrounding townships. Cities have their own police departments, fire departments, park systems, and they take care of their own streets. To the contrary, townships rely on county services such as the county sheriff, volunteer fire departments, the county park systems, the county road commission, and they deliver fewer services because they are restricted to 5 mils of taxes. However you draw districts for State House, State Senate, and Congress. Please keep the 6 cities together as much as possible.\\n   \n",
       "305  As a resident of East Grand Rapids, I’m writing to ask you to keep the core metro six cities together as much as possible in state house, state senate, and congressional districts. \\n\\nThese urban cities (Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Walker, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids) are significantly different from the surrounding townships that are mostly rural or far out suburban and therefore are interested in different laws coming from Lansing and DC. \\n\\nFirst, these two groups divide themselves on a state-wide and local level. At the state level, cities are organized into the Michigan Municipal League and townships are in the Michigan Townships Association. Here in Kent County, the six cities meet in the Urban Metro Mayors and Managers and the townships get together as the Kent County Township Supervisors group. So, you can see that when municipalities group into federations they divide cities from townships, and you should do the same. \\n\\nSecond, cities and townships are just different in Michigan law, in how their residents encounter local government, and in the issues that they deal with. \\nCities have their own police departments, fire department, parks, and have water/sewer infrastructure. A representative from a city will be more focused on working on behalf of cities and their particular issues. \\nTownships are not allowed to have more than 2 (by trustees) or 5 (with voter approval) mills of property taxes, so they offer far fewer services. They tend to rely on state and county governments for their law enforcement (the Sheriff), parks, and roads (county road commission). Township residents in Michigan tend to have septic systems and wells, instead of being on piped water and sewer. A representative from a township will be more focused on working on behalf of townships and their particular and unique issues.\\n\\nFinally, the six metro cities combine with only themselves on services such as public transit (The Rapid) and garbage (the incinerator). \\n\\nSo, for all of these reasons, try to draw maps that keep cities with cities and townships with townships. In Kent County, that means keeping the core six cities together as much as possible. In the last gerrymandered state house map, East Grand Rapids was put together with exurban and rural townships that don't share our interests and I think that shouldn't happen this time.

Kentwood is a highly diverse but community-oriented part of West Michigan centered around an incredibly inclusive school system. That school system's identity ties together the diverse voices of the area and allows people to find their first \"home.\" Statistically, this cultural hearth I believe is relevant to politics because, despite ethnic and national differences within the community, community voters are conscious of the Kentwood community on a business and education level. That deserves a concrete voice.   \n",

       "344  My name is Charlie and I live in Grand Rapids, Michigan. My Community of Interest is called the Southern Grand Rapids Metropolitan Area. \\n\\nI’m asking the commission to draw districts that keep our community intact! \\n\\nWe are compromised of the southern half of Grand Rapids, and the entire cities of Wyoming, and Kentwood. There are roughly 200,000 residents in our community of interest. \\n\\nThe City of Wyoming Vision statement perfectly summarizes the character of our community, “A diverse, strong, and authentic community where all individuals have the opportunity to thrive.” \\n\\nIf you find yourself in town, I hope you’ll visit the Beltine Bar for the world famous wet burrito! \\n\\nHistorically, our Community has been a mix of working classes suburbs, but we are quickly urbanizing and growing. In fact, we are the fasting growing area in Kent County. \\n\\nThe rapid growth of our community requires representation that understands the issues and challenges we face. Our top issues include, affordable housing, environmental clean up, and improving reliable mass transit.\\n\\nThe cost of housing is going up quickly. In fact, my rent has increased 5% in this past year alone. As for the health and safety of our community, we have half of Kent county’s federal superfund cleanup sites, even though we represent only 1/4 of the county population. \\n\\nFor a community of 200,000, it is frustrating that we were split apart by the 2011 district maps. Currently, we are in two congressional districts, 3 State Senate Districts, and 5 State House Districts. \\n\\nWe deserve to be represented by 1 congressional district, 2 state house districts, and 1 state senate district. \\nThis commission can help the Southern Grand Rapids Metropolitan Community of Interest by drawing district lines that keep our community whole.    \n",

Both school districts have a fair percentage of minority students and students receiving free and reduced-price school meals, meaning their parents have many social and economic interests in common. Right now these parents have to talk to 2 Michigan House Representatives/district and their influence is diminished when they try to lobby their representatives. They should all be part of one district and if House District 90 went all the way west to Lake Michigan, while not extending as far east, that would put most of both districts under one Michigan House seat.    \n",

These are Grand Rapids, Walker, Grandville, Wyoming, Kentwood, and East Grand Rapids. They are a clear community of interest based on shared services and similar forms of government. The 6 cities have several unique partnerships that they do together and not with outlying townships. The most well known is that they share the Rapid Transit System. They also partner together to send all their garbage to the incinerator which burns garbage to produce energy. This is the only incinerator that remains in use in Michigan. Many of the 6 cities also partner with the city of Grand Rapids on water and sewer, such as Kentwood, East Grand Rapids, and Walker. The 6 cities also share a form of government that is dramatically different than surrounding townships. Cities have their own police departments, fire departments, park systems, and they take care of their own streets. To the contrary, townships rely on county services such as the county sheriff, volunteer fire departments, the county park systems, the county road commission, and they deliver fewer services because they are restricted to 5 mils of taxes. How ever you draw districts for State House, State Senate, and Congress. Please keep the 6 cities together as much as possible.   \n",

They are a multiracial, multigendered class. they come from many countries, hold many religious beliefs, or none at all. They are black, Brown, and white people. They sometimes vote for one of the two major parties because they don't have many options, don't have billions of dollars to finance a new party. Sometimes they vote for other parties in protest, sometimes they don't vote at all and feel alienated by how \"Democracy\" works. They are angry that billioanires in West Michigan control most of the poltiical processes here.    \n",

Kentwood is a highly diverse but community-oriented part of West Michigan centered around an incredibly inclusive school system. That school system's identity ties together the diverse voices of the area and allows people to find their first \"home.\" Statistically, this cultural hearth I believe is relevant to politics because, despite ethnic and national differences within the community, community voters are conscious of the Kentwood community on a business and education level. That deserves a concrete voice.   \n",
